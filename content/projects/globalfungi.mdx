We created an interactive cartographic visualization of the **GlobalFungi dataset** (Větrovský T. et al, 2020, GlobalFungi, globalfungi.com), with a focus on Amanita muscaria. While the full dataset is available in point and hex-bin formats, our project goes further by linking fungal samples to their environmental conditions.

Users can explore individual sample properties, such as **pH level, biome, temperature, and precipitation** by clicking on sample points. Complementary graphs illustrate the relationships between environmental factors and fungal distribution, helping reveal how geography and climate shape the presence of Amanita muscaria.

The project was created in 2023, summer semester of the Location-Based Services course at TU Vienna. It was selected as one of the [**best projects**](https://cartographymaster.eu/general-news/the-best-digital-cartographic-projects-of-the-summer-semester-2023/) of the semester.
