##### Summary
I enjoy experimenting with data visualization in **R**, particularly with thematic maps like **cartograms**. For the example below, I used the **WDI** package to retrieve population and GDP per capita data from the World Bank, and combined it with **cartogram**, **sf**, **gganimate**, and **ggplot2** to visualize population distribution on a map across Africa. The animation implies a slight negative relation between GDP and population, however, due to the lack of GDP data of some countries, the maps are not fully reliable.
