##### Introduction
The project was created under Sustainable Urban Planning and Design Studio at KTH, Stockholm in 2019-2020. In this study, we focused on Sweden’s Million Housing Program, a mass housing initiative from the 1960s and 70s. Our case area was Hallunda–Norsborg, a suburb at the last stop of the red metro line in southern Stockholm. The area has serious integration problems and a negative image, mostly due to the high number of immigrants and its distance from the city center.

##### Method
As a group of three, we focused on adolescents living in the area—a minority group affected by the program’s outdated conditions. One of the main issues was their strong dependence on family due to conservative cultural norms, which limits their ability to live independently. Based on interviews and surveys with local youth, we created a concept diagram showing how their needs are not supported by the current urban structure. Our concept was then developed into an urban design proposal.

##### Master planning
In the master plan phase of the project, establishing meaningful connections between scales was essential. After conducting detailed analysis and developing urban design ideas, we focused on how these solutions could work together at the planning scale. To do this, we studied the correlation between functional zones and key focus areas (neighbourhood corners) and how these corners relate to each other. Based on this analysis and our chosen design approach, the final master plan was developed.

##### Image - event space
We focused on a large parking lot, which we reimagined as a temporary event space for social interaction. Oversized and underused parking areas were common across the site, so we saw potential in transforming them into community spaces.

##### Model - art academy
For the model, we proposed connecting residential areas with leisure spaces through landscape elements. We used texture, trees, and building placement to separate functions and create a more engaging atmosphere. The goal was to support youth needs and encourage more inclusive use of public space.
