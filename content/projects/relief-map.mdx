##### Summary
This project reflects my growing interest in data visualization, especially spatial data **visualization in R**. I set out to create a beautiful terrain map of Italy using a pink color scale. The map was generated using **terra**, **rayshader**, and **elevatr**, and the final layout was designed in **Adobe Illustrator**. While it's a simple map, it represents my ongoing progress and enthusiasm for learning and experimenting with visual techniques in R.
