##### What is is about?
The project aimed to develop an aesthetically pleasing, map-focused online platform offering touristic accessibility information for individuals with limited mobility in Munich's city center. The resulting website features interactive web maps highlighting essential amenities and multiple sightseeing routes, categorized according to key tourist attractions.

##### How we built it
The geospatial data of accessible places are collected from OpenStreetMap. With Python Pandas library, we performed data pre-processing. We used QGIS and ArcGIS Pro to manipulate spatial data sets, especially to adjust routes and attributes for accessibility then convert them into geoJSON to be used for online mapping. Our website was built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. We decided to use Mapbox Studio and Mapbox GL JS because of its rich features and customizability. We also used Adobe Illustrator to create custom icons for our map.
