##### Summary
The project was developed as part of the “Virtual 3D Landscape” course at TU Dresden. 3D modeling was carried out using Blender, following the preparation of 2D data in ArcGIS Pro and AutoCAD. Both raster and vector textures were applied, with building textures custom-made in Adobe Photoshop by editing screen captures from Google Street View.
